# DNS Providers Help

A DNS Provider is a service that hosts your domain(s) and this will be
specifically used when requesting new _Certificates_ via DNS Validation.

It is preferred to use DNS Validation, so check if your domain is hosted with
one of the supported Acme.sh providers:

- [DNS Page 1](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi)
- [DNS Page 2](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi2)

Should your DNS Provider be supported by Acme.sh and not available in this
project, please
[open an issue on Github](https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager/issues/new/choose).
